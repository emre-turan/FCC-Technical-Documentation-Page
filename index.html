                <p>
                    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a
                    document
                    written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how
                    elements
                    should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.
                </p>
                <p>CSS is among the core languages of the open web and is standardized across Web browsers according to
                    W3C
                    specifications. Previously, the development of various parts of CSS specification was done
                    synchronously, which allowed the versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard
                    about
                    CSS1, CSS2.1, or even CSS3. There will never be a CSS3 or a CSS4; rather, everything is now CSS
                    without
                    a version number.</p>
                <p>After CSS 2.1, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress on different
                    CSS
                    modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to develop and release
                    recommendations
                    separately per module. Instead of versioning the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a
                    snapshot of the latest stable state of the CSS specification and individual modules progress. CSS
                    modules now have version numbers, or levels, such as CSS Color Module Level 5</p>

            <p>CSS first steps</p>
            <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font,
                color,
                size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other
                decorative
                features. This module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of
                how it
                works, what the syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.
            </p>
            <p>CSS building blocks</p>
            <p>This module carries on where CSS first steps left off — now you've gained familiarity with the language
                and
                its syntax, and got some basic experience with using it, it's time to dive a bit deeper. This module
                looks
                at the cascade and inheritance, all the selector types we have available, units, sizing, styling
                backgrounds
                and borders, debugging, and lots more.</p>
            <p>The aim here is to provide you with a toolkit for writing competent CSS and help you understand all the
                essential theory, before moving on to more specific disciplines like text styling and CSS layout.

            </p>
            <p>CSS styling text</p>
            <p>With the basics of the CSS language covered, the next CSS topic for you to concentrate on is styling text
                —
                one of the most common things you'll do with CSS. Here we look at text styling fundamentals, including
                setting font, boldness, italics, line and letter spacing, drop shadows, and other text features. We
                round
                off the module by looking at applying custom fonts to your page, and styling lists and links.</p>
            <p>CSS layout</p>
            <p>At this point we've already looked at CSS fundamentals, how to style text, and how to style and
                manipulate
                the boxes that your content sits inside. Now it's time to look at how to place your boxes in the right
                place
                in relation to the viewport, and to each other. We have covered the necessary prerequisites so we can
                now
                dive deep into CSS layout, looking at different display settings, modern layout tools like flexbox, CSS
                grid, and positioning, and some of the legacy techniques you might still want to know about.</p>
